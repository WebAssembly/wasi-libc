/**
 * <wasi/api.h>. This file contains declarations describing the WASI ABI
 * as of "snapshot preview1". It was originally auto-generated from
 * wasi_snapshot_preview1.witx, however WASI is in the process of
 * transitioning to a new IDL and header file generator, and this file
 * is temporarily being manually maintained.

 * @file
 * This file describes the [WASI] interface, consisting of functions, types,
 * and defined values (macros).
 *
 * The interface described here is greatly inspired by [CloudABI]'s clean,
 * thoughtfully-designed, capability-oriented, POSIX-style API.
